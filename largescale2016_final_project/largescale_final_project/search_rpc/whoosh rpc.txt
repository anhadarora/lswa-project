\f0\fs24 \cf0 whoosh search creates a directory to hold index files of documents that it writes to, searches, and deletes. each item is a document that is indexed with 3 fields- the item id, the name of the item, and a description. it uses the item id to delete an index, and searches through the index looking for matches from a user-inputted query to the name or description field. \
\
the directory should only be created once, or the files will be overwritten with each call to the rpc. the directory is created in the current working directory. in this case, it\'92s called whoosh_index\
